## OVERVIEW
**The Concept of Foodle**

As a society, we've evolved from hunting and gathering food on our own to ordering food through the drive thru at our local eatery. The old time tradition of preparing and eating healthy food has been mostly put aside for the sake of convenience. But at what cost?

What Foodle sets out to achieve is to present its users with the ability to plan what they'd like to eat ahead of time for the week, month, etc. Users will be able to search and select recipes from a database born of collaboration with online sources as well as personal contributions from other users. They will also have the ability to rate their favorite recipes, photograph their food creations, and post those creations for their followers and community to view.

## PROBLEM
**Ideas Without a Direction**

Our client had the idea of creating a new application that would be able to fit in under the broad umbrella of online content storage and organization with a focus on content creation, organization and collaboration. The app needed to be able to leverage the “network effect” to ensure positive growth so collaboration was a big focus. With this in mind I knew that a social sharing application could have a strong foundation to build on. With this as my starting point, I started thinking about what people of all types might have in common.

After researching different ideas I came to the conclusion that food would be an interesting and uniting focal point for this application. It is widely popular with all types of demographics and people love to post and share what they eat when they are eating it. What better way to bring people together than with their obsession with food.

## SOLUTION
**Finding a Niche Market**

The solution I proposed was to explore the idea of food as a unifying concept that could incorporate sharing, content creation and collaboration. These were the biggest deliverables our client requested and following this approach allowed for more creative exploration in a niche area not over-saturated by a multitude of similar applications.

The problem as I saw it was I needed to “Establish an app direction that refined the clients requirements into a deliverable that can stand out in a saturated market.”

After reviewing this list again, I saw this as sort of a recipe with each of the requirements as ingredients, with one part organization, a dash or collaboration, a sprinkle of online posting, and the main ingredient. FOOD!

That’s how the idea of Foodle was born.
